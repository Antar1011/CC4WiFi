What is CC4Wifi?
	CC4Wifi is a program that makes it easy to play Challenge Cup on your DS. It generates six pkm files that are easily imported into a game save using Pokesav. The pokemon in these pkm files will DEFINITELY NOT pass hack checks and are designed EXCLUSIVELY for use in Challenge Cup matches.

What is Challenge Cup?
	Challenge Cup is kind of like Pokedex Roulette, only on crack. Not only are the Pokemon in the match random, but so are the movesets, items, IVs, EVs, natures, etc. And unlike Pokedex Roulette, Challenge Cup utlizes a "level balance" rule--the weaker the pokemon, the higher its level. Conventionally, Challenge Cup is played with different rules than your standard Wi-Fi battle. Of course, feel free to play by whichever rules you wish.
	Challenge Cup Rules:
		-No Team Preview! Cover your top screen when you enter the battle. Also, you MUST lead with the first pokemon in your party, the one you imported from Poke1.pkm. If you're playing CC Doubles/Triples, same thing--the order MUST be the same!
		-No Sleep/Freeze Clause! Does one of your pokemon have Spore? SPAM IT!
		-No Evasion Clause! Double Team? Mimimize? Par for the course.
		-No OHKO Clause! Horn Drill/Fissure/Sheer Cold are legal. Remember that these moves don't work if the target pokemon is at a higher level than the one attempting the move.

Instructions:
	-Unzip to somewhere that's convenient for you. I like the desktop.
	-Double-click on and run:
		-WINDOWS: CC4Wifi.bat
		-MAC: CC4Wifi.command
		-LINUX: CC4Wifi.sh
	-Six numbered pkm files will be generated on your desktop in the folder CC
	-Open a Black & White sav file of your choice in Pokesav or Pokegen. Unless this file is just for challenge cup, you'll probably want to make a backup.
	-Load the pkm files IN ORDER into the six party slots. Make sure to set "Party Amount" to 6 if you're using Pokesav. It's not a good idea to load the files to a box, since you'll have issues with mail.
	-Save your sav file, load it onto your retail cart, flash cart, or w/e, hop on Wi-Fi, and battle a friend!
	-When you're ready for your next match, just run CC4Wifi.bat/command/sh again. Your old team will be overwritten (so back it up if you want to save it for reference purposes).
